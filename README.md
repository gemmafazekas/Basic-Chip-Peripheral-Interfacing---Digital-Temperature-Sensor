# Basic-Chip-Peripheral-Interfacing---Digital-Temperature-Sensor
This is the project for ECE387 at Miami University. For my project, I want to use a digital temperature sensor to measure the temperature of the surrounding area. This would be a simulation of basic thermometers seen in cars so people do not overheat or are too cold within the vehicle.
I will be using the DS18B20 digital temperature sensor from adafruit for this implementation.
